I am Franco Sirena, a Software Engineer who happens to love working with Frontend... Nah, I am actually more like a JS and WEB enthusiast, from automation to everything 👨🏻‍💻

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Staff Engineer, focused on Frontend, using React, Testing Library, Redux, React-Router, name it. But I often do some Node stuff, some Kubernets stuff, which I love by the way. 
- 📍 Based in Rotterdam / Netherlands
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Python, because I love to learn and Python seemed extremely easy to get my hands around and Rust is more like a personal challenge.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with the JS community in general and making the places that I work more diverse and inclusive.
- 💬 Ask me about React, Javascript, Testing Library, NodeJS, SCSS/CSS that sort of Web related stuff. And, **of course**, craftbeer 🍺 or just beard grooming 🧔🏻
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a Brazilian with an Italian passport who lived in Portugal and now lives in the Netherlands 🇧🇷 🇮🇹 🇵🇹 🇳🇱
